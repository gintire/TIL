# Advanced Kubectl Commands
> Q. A set of Persistent Volumes are available. Sort them based on their capacity
```
kubectl get pv --sort-by=.spec.capacity.storage > /opt/outputs/storage-capacity-sorted.txt
```

> Q.  That was good, but we don't need all the extra details. Retrieve just the first 2 columns of output and store it in /opt/outputs/pv-and-capacity-sorted.txt
> The columns should be named NAME and CAPACITY. Use the custom-columns option. And remember it should still be sorted as in the previous question.
```
>kubectl get pv --sort-by=.spec.capacity.storage -o=custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,CAPACITY:.spec.capacity.storage
```

> Use a JSON PATH query to identify the context configured for the aws-user in the my-kube-config context file and store the result in /opt/outputs/aws-context-name.

```
kubectl config view --kubeconfig=my-kube-config -o jsonpath="{.contexts[?(@.context.user=='aws-user')].name}" > /opt/outputs/aws-context-name
```
